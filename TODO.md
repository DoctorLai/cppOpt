- add ways to store data (maybe make this user-implementable aswell or provide sub-classes)
- allow algorithms to leave boundaries  
- taboo areas  
- carefully check the evolutionary behaviour  
- evolutionary mutations won't check for borders (only relevant if the algorithms should have to stay within their borders)  
- Set MultiThreaded in examples explicitly
- forward instead of move in constructors?
- range based for loops
- const& where possible especially T values
- std::function wrapper helpers which add logging etc.
- check for unnecessary includes (especially examples)
- check public/private correct
- enable overload for coordinator without multithreading which simply requires run_optimisation without number threads
- update readme and tag with version
