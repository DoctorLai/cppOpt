- add ways to store data (maybe make this user-implementable aswell or provide sub-classes)
- optimise for speed  
- make it easy to use external plotting tools  
- allow algorithms to leave boundaries  
- taboo areas  
- carefully check the evolutionary behaviour  
- evolutionary mutations won't check for borders (only relevant if the algorithms should have to stay within their borders)  
- use better mutex locking (read/write RAII)
- way to reset static state
