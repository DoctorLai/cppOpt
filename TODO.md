#features
##saving data
add ways to store data (maybe make this user-implementable aswell or provide sub-classes)
#other
optimise for speed
allow logging and other output solutions
add a method to easily split OptBoundaries or vectors of them (split direction, times) returning a vector of vector of Boundaries
make proper cmake which will create the library, and compile examples / tests
rename the main.cpp to something like example1 and add some more examples
method to get the best result
all result better usages have to pass the targetValue, otherwise they will fail on usage (simply remove the default value)
make it possible to get the best result of an algorithm (to easily test them later)
add a file to fest all algorithms by letting them minimize /maximize etc. a problem and have their result be close to some value
either optimise or optimize (both correct)
