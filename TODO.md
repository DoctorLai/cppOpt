- allow algorithms to leave boundaries  
- taboo areas  
- carefully check the evolutionary behaviour  
- evolutionary mutations won't check for borders (only relevant if the algorithms should have to stay within their borders)  
- forward instead of move in constructors?
- const& where possible especially T values
- enable overload for coordinator without multithreading which simply requires run_optimisation without number threads
- update readme and tag with version
