- building on windows currently fails (c++11 flag doesn't seem to work)
- add ways to store data (maybe make this user-implementable aswell or provide sub-classes)
- optimise for speed  
- make it easy to use external plotting tools  
- more examples  
- great deluge isn't used in an example (nor the evolutionary)  
- allow algorithms to leave boundaries  
- taboo areas  
- carefully check the evolutionary behaviour  
- evolutionary mutations won't check for borders (only relevant if the algorithms should have to stay within their borders)  
- add splitting example to examples
