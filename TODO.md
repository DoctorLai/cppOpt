- add ways to store data (maybe make this user-implementable aswell or provide sub-classes)
- optimise for speed  
- make it easy to use external plotting tools  
- allow algorithms to leave boundaries  
- taboo areas  
- carefully check the evolutionary behaviour  
- evolutionary mutations won't check for borders (only relevant if the algorithms should have to stay within their borders)  
- read/write locks and a mode where when selecting only one thread to run on, the locking is disabled
- OptCalculation must be templated
- only use one mutex?
- OptBase could reset result etc. once last child disconnects
- Set MultiThreaded in examples explicitly
- Once OptBase is a controler object, consider writing a threadsafety wrapper (instead of locking within)
- forward instead of move in constructors?
